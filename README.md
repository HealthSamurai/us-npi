## Local development

Clone an `env` file to a Git-ignored `env_dev` as follows:

```bash
cp env env_dev
```

Edit this file and provide your own `DB_*` values. Load the config:

```bash
source env_dev
```

To run REPL:

```bash
make repl
```

To build and run an uberjar:

```
make
# or make uberjar-build uberjar-run
```

Make sure you've got `sed`, `unzip` and `7z` command line tools installed and
accessible from your PATH. You'll also need `psql` tool installed which is a
part of `postgresql-client` package.
